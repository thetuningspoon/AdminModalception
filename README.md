# Modalception for ProcessWire
Improves usability of ProcessWire's modal dialog/popup windows when opened from within another modal window. The parent window is expanded to take up the full screen behind it so that additional modals can be opened without the inner windows becoming progressively smaller and less usable. The outer windows' toolbars are hidden from the user to help reduce confusion and possible data loss. This module is particularly helpful when using Page Field Edit Links (https://github.com/thetuningspoon/AdminPageFieldEditLinks)
